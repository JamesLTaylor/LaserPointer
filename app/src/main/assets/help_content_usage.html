<h3>Start</h3>
<p>To start sending mouse moves for changes in phone orientation press start.  The button then changes to a Stop button which has
the obvious effect.</p>
<h3>Moving left and right</h3>
<p>Roll the hand left and right.  There are pictures of the hand position <a href="http://cogn.co.za/LaserPointer/">online</a>.</p>
<p>The reason that a roll is required is that the accelerometer is used to determine the angle rather than the gyroscope.</p>
<h3>Moving up and down</h3>
<p>Moving the cursor up and down is exactly as you would expect, simply tilt the phone to point to the top or bottom of the screen.</p>
<h3>Resetting the IP address</h3>
<p>Type in the new IP address and press the reset button.</p>
<h3>CTRL and left button down</h3>
<p>Microsoft power point changes to the mouse cursor to a red dot when ctrl and the left button are held down.
This switch achieves this for you.  One must be a bit careful to turn it off when it is no longer required because
your computer can be hard to work with if it acts as though the CTRL key is permanently held down.

<h3>Keep screen on</h3>
<p>This forces the phone screen to stay on.  Messages will stop being sent when the screen turns off.</p>
<h3>Previous</h3>
<p>Send the page up key to the computer.  In most applications this will move you to the previous slide.</p>
<h3>Next</h3>

<h3>Click</h3>
<p>Send a left mouse click at the current cursor location.  Can be useful for bringing the focus to the application
with the presentation.</p>
<h3>Calibrating</h3>
<p>If you find that the default angles that you need to hold the phone at are unnatural or don't suit the angle of the actual
screen that you are using then you can cange 1 or all of the angles.  Simple click on the angle you want to set, hold the phone at the
desired angle and "OK" </p>
