# LaserPointer

This project is for an Android app that emulates mouse movements and a few other keys so that a phone can be used as a pointer during a presentation.  See a description of the product at <https://www.cogn.co.za/LaserPointer>.

The project is closely linked with the server that needs to run on the machine giving the presentation, see [here](https://github.com/JamesLTaylor/LaserPointerServer/blob/master/README.md).
